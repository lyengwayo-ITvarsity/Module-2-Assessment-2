                    <h3>APPLE</h3>
                    <p>Apple Store is a chain of retail stores owned and operated by Apple Inc. The stores sell various Apple products, including Mac personal computers, iPhone smartphones, iPad tablet computers, iPod portable media players, Apple Watch smartwatches, Apple TV digital media players, software, and selected third-party accessories.</p>
                    <p>Many Apple Stores are located inside shopping malls, but Apple has built several stand-alone flagship stores in high-profile locations, such as the one located in Grand Central Terminal in New York City and the Marina Bay Sands in Singapore.</p>
