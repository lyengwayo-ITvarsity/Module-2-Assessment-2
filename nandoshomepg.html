                    <h3>NANDO'S</h3>
                    <p>The story of Nando’s starts hundreds of years ago with the first Portuguese explorers who set sail for the East in search of the legendary spice route. And so they landed on our shores and discovered the African Bird’s Eye Chilli or as we know it (and love it), PERi-PERi. Today, many years later, you can find Nando’s restaurants, our delicious, addictive sauces and our world-famous grocery range around the globe.</p>
                    <p>‘Why Nando’s?’ That’s a good question, but also a question with no definitive answer. In fact, if you asked everyone who worked for us, you’d probably get a different answer every time. For some it may be the fact that we’re the kind of name that’s on everyone’s lips. For others it may be the fact that we’ve won awards for being a great place to work and continually invest in our people. To be on the safe side, we’ll go over a few of the reasons why people join u</p>
